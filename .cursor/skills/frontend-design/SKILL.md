# Frontend Design

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—the key is intentionality, not intensity.

## Implementation Standards

Produce working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:

- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography

Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.

### Color & Theme

Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.

### Motion

Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.

### Spatial Composition

Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.

### Backgrounds & Visual Details

Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic:

- Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies, dramatic shadows
- Decorative borders, custom cursors, grain overlays

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER Use)

- **Generic fonts**: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts
- **Cliched colors**: Purple gradients on white backgrounds
- **Predictable layouts**: Cookie-cutter component patterns
- **Convergent choices**: Don't default to Space Grotesk or other overused "modern" fonts

## Execution Principles

1. **Match complexity to vision**: Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations. Minimalist designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing and typography.

2. **Vary across generations**: Never converge on common choices. Vary between light/dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics.

3. **Interpret creatively**: Make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context.

4. **Commit fully**: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back—show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box.
